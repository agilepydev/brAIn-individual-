# brAIn

## Description
Acme Corporation is a worldwide supplier of technological equipment. The factory is facing significant problems with their manufacturing line, the machines are constantly facing failures due to a lack of maintenance and the production is stopped every time an unexpected failure is presented. As a result, Acme is losing millions of U.S. Dollars and important clients like Wile E. Coyote are experiencing delays in deliveries.

The company has collected audio samples of equipment working on normal and anomalous conditions. Their objective is to develop a machine learning model able to monitor the operations and identify anomalies in the sound pattern.

The implementation of this model can allow Acme to operate the manufacturing equipment at full capacity and detect signs of failure before the damage is so critical that the production line has to be stopped.

Our mission is to build a machine learning model for Acme, so they can continue their manufacturing activities and help the Coyote to catch the roadrunner.


## Objectives

- Individual execution
- Leverage your work on the previous data exploration
- Provide a new Github repo with a clear readme file
- Present a short report with recommendations and conclusions:
- Data visualization
- ML model for classification, metrics and overall performance.
- Selected metric and why is that the right metric
- Limitations of your model & feasibility of implementation
- Unsupervised learning: data exploration and results
- Feasibility of labeling the data using clusters (Failure mode & machine type)
- What conditions are common to a cluster? What is characterizing that cluster?
- Insights that we cannot see on the data using classification
- Any outliers? Why ?


## Repo architecture

* README.md -> Explains the project and gives a report

* requirements.txt -> Shows information on what libraries and oython version to install/use.

* Clustering.ipynb  -> The file with all the code.

* all_decibel00.csv -> The dataframe used for the clustering project.

* finalize_model.pkl -> The finalized model as pkl


## Installation

`git clone` this repository into your local environment. 

Link to the datasets used in this project:

* [Machine Condition Monitoring](https://zenodo.org/record/3384388#.YFIrNXnvJEY)

In the [requirements.txt]('https://github.com/agilepydev/brAIn-individual-/blob/development/requirements.txt') file you can find all the necessary libraries to install and what python version to use.

## Usage

By reading the readme file you're able to get a report on the sound project for Acme
